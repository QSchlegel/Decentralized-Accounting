# Decentralized-Accounting

This project was funded by Project Catalyst Fund 3.
The goal of this project is creating a prototype of an accounting / book keeping system on the Cardano Blockchain.

If you would like to use this code for your project you can do so.

But please note that this is a prototype, which is not for production use!
I did not test this code in a comprehensive manner.
Thus the code should be used like an inspiration.

Best Regards
Quirin Schlegel
